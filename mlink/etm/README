ptm2human: ARM PTM (and ETMv4) trace to human-readable format
=============================================================

[About]:
ptm2human is a decoder for trace data outputted by Program Trace Macrocell
(PTM) [1][2] and Embedded Trace Macrocell (ETMv4) [3].
It deconstructs ID packets and data packets from the formatter of ARM Coresight ETB [4],
and then translates the trace data to a human-readable format. 

[Build]:
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make

[Usage]:
-----
 PTM
-----
1. Save the PTM trace stream into a file.
2. Give the trace file to ptm2human:
        $ ptm2human -p -i /path/to/trace/file -c 4
   The result is printed to the stdout. Redirect it to a output file:
        $ ptm2human -p -i /path/to/trace/file -c 4 1> /path/to/output/file
3. Read traces in a human-readable format:
        $ more output.log
        Reading ptm_trace_stream.o

-------
 ETMv4
-------
1. Save the ETMv4 trace stream into a file.
2. Give the trace file to ptm2human:
        $ ptm2human -e -i /path/to/trace/file
   The result is printed to the stdout. Redirect it to a output file:
        $ ptm2human -e -i /path/to/trace/file 1> /path/to/output/file
3. Read traces in a human-readable format:
        $ less output.log

[TODO]:
1. Support ETMv4 data traces.
2. Translate the traced address to the source file and the line number.
